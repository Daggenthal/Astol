# Astol
Astol is the Python 3 implementation of my scripts from my /Scripts repository.

This took me about 2 hours to complete, with countless Googling, as this is my first ever Python / Python 3 program!

I knew that if I just kept at it, I could get it done and convert my scripts from Bash, to Python 3. I've wanted to do this for a while now, but never really did it. I just sat down and knocked it out so I wouldn't have to run two scripts anymore anytime I ran a new VM, haha.
