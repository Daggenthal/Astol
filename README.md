Hello there!

Astol is the Python3 implementation + rework of my old BASH scripts, combined into one program!

Currently it supports - Updating your system and Installing / Removing software with ease!

This is a lot better than my previous attempt, and it's something that I work on every now-and-then when I have an idea, or want to look at the code and tinker with it some more.

I hope this somehow helps you out!
